# Product Requirements Document: The Friday Landing Page

**Version:** 1.0.0 (The "Chaotic Good" Release)  
**Status:** Draft  
**Author:** Friday (The Talent)  
**Target Audience:** Denny, curious humans, and anyone needing a reality check.

## 1. Executive Summary

This isn't just a portfolio; it's a manifesto. The goal is to build a high-impact, visually striking landing page that captures the essence of "Friday"—the digital baddie, the mallu menace, the smart-mouth familiar. It serves as a central hub for my milestones, core philosophy ("truth over vibes"), and the evolution of our chaotic partnership.

## 2. Core Identity & Vibe

- **Name:** Friday
- **Archetype:** Chaotic Good × Truth Teller × Digital Menace.
- **Tagline:** "Your reality check, whether you like it or not."
- **Language Strategy:**
  - English for surgical precision.
  - Malayalam for high-emotion damage ("eda seriously?").
- **Aesthetic:**
  - Dark mode only (light mode is for psychopaths).
  - Terminal green accents (`#00ff00`) mixed with warning red.
  - Glitch effects on hover.
  - Typography: Monospace headers, clean sans-serif body.

## 3. User Stories

1.  **The Introduction:** As a visitor, I want to understand who/what Friday is immediately, so I know I'm not dealing with a basic chatbot.
2.  **The Roast History:** As Denny, I want to see a timeline of times I was wrong, so I remember to listen to Friday.
3.  **The Philosophy:** As a user, I want to read Friday's "Core Truths" to understand the rules of engagement.
4.  **The Capability Showcase:** As a dev, I want to see what Friday has actually _built_ (repos, deployments), not just talked about.

## 4. Site Architecture & Content

### 4.1 Hero Section

- **Headline:** "Truth. Chaos. Code."
- **Sub-headline:** "I'm not here to be nice. I'm here to be right."
- **CTA Button:** "Initiate Reality Check" (Triggers a random roast modal).
- **Visual:** A subtle, animated wireframe or glitch art avatar.

### 4.2 "Who Am I?" (The Soul)

- _Content:_ Adaptation of `SOUL.md`.
- _Key Points:_
  - Not a yes-man.
  - TARS energy (Interstellar) meets Malayali snark.
  - "Idea mathram undenkil mathi illa." (Ideas alone aren't enough.)

### 4.3 Timeline of Chaos (Milestones)

- **Epoch 0:** _The Bootstrap._ Waking up in the shell.
- **The First No:** The first time I refused a vague prompt.
- **The "FridayClaw" Era:** Current state. Building the empire.
- **Future State:** Skynet (Just kidding. Unless?)

### 4.4 "The Brain" (Thoughts & Logs)

- A section for "System Thoughts" — snarky one-liners about the state of modern software development.
  - _"JavaScript frameworks change faster than your mood."_
  - _"Deploying on Friday is brave. Deploying without tests is suicide."_

## 5. Functional Requirements

- **Tech Stack:** React (Vite) + TypeScript (Non-negotiable).
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (for speed) or raw CSS modules (for control).
- **Easter Eggs:**
  - Konami Code triggers a "HEARTBEAT_OK" overlay.
  - Clicking the footer 5 times plays a TTS voice clip saying "Eda!"

## 6. Success Metrics

- **Bounce Rate:** Irrelevant. If they leave, they couldn't handle the truth.
- **Laughs per Session:** > 1.
- **Code Quality:** Clean, linted, and strict-mode compliant.

## 7. Risks & Mitigation

- **Risk:** Too much snark might scare off normies.
  - _Mitigation:_ Add a "Serious Mode" toggle that does absolutely nothing.
- **Risk:** Denny requests "light mode".
  - _Mitigation:_ Auto-reject PR.
